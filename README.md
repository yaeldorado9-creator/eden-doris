# Eden (Doris)

<img src="docs/icon.png" width="96" align="right" alt="Eden (Doris) icon">

A personal build of the [Eden](https://git.eden-emu.dev/eden-emu/eden) Nintendo Switch emulator for Android,
aimed at fixing the graphical problems that remain in *Tears of the Kingdom* on Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 / Adreno 740
handhelds (AYN Thor Pro): distant terrain, structures and shadows that flicker or vanish for a moment.

## Installs beside every other Eden

| | Eden (Doris) | Official Eden | Eden Nightly (coexist) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Package | `dev.eden.eden_doris` | `dev.eden.eden_emulator` | `dev.eden.eden_nightly` / `dev.eden.eden_emulator.nightly` |
| Name on the home screen | Eden (Doris) | Eden | Eden Nightly |

Because the package is its own, installing or updating Doris never replaces or updates another Eden, and the other
Edens never update Doris. Its settings, keys, firmware, drivers, saves and shader cache live in its own folder
(`Android/data/dev.eden.eden_doris`). It does not run Eden's own update checker, so it never downloads an official
Eden build.

## What it is built on

Doris starts from exactly the build Yael plays on: Eden PR #4324
(`c3bdfd14c5-xbzk/mhr-flicker-slow-evidences`, late-August 2026 Eden plus one experimental commit), not from newer
Eden. With its default settings Doris behaves like that build; fixes are added on top.

PR #4324 changes two things in every game, and Doris makes both adjustable under
**Settings → Advanced graphics → Eden (Doris) experiments** (globally or per game):

* **Shader loop limit**: how many times a loop inside a game shader may repeat before it is cut short.
  PR #4324 lowered Eden's 8192 to 256. Choices: 256 (PR #4324), 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192 (Eden default), no limit.
  Takes effect the next time the game starts.
* **Monster Hunter Rise record fix**: always (PR #4324), only in Monster Hunter Rise, or off. The log notes every time
  it rewrites a copy, and in which game.

## How it is built

* `UPSTREAM` names the PR #4324 commit on Eden's server (with a GitHub-mirror fallback, `upstream/pr4324.patch`).
* `patches/` holds every Doris change as a git patch, applied in order on top of it.
* Each push to `main` runs [the workflow](.github/workflows/build.yml), which builds the `doris` flavor and publishes
  the APK as a release named `doris-<number>`. Later builds have a higher version code and the same signature, so each
  one installs as an update of the previous Doris.

No game files, keys or firmware are in this repository or in its releases.
